## This is simple terraform to provision an AWS VPC with public and private subnets and EC2 instance running Nginx.

#### Note:
 For simplicity, this setup does not include remote terraform state file.
 In a production environment/best practice better to store the Terraform state in an S3 bucket
 with a DynamoDB table for state locking.
